## 😈 Tone — Sharper, Sinister, Unforgiving

This README is aggressively red-team focused. It intimidates complacency, drives action, and emphasizes full-spectrum offensive simulation — all authorized, all ethical.

---

## 🎯 Mission — Pressure, Expose, Obliterate Weakness

I don’t just test — I *pressure* systems until they reveal vulnerabilities. Then I carve up telemetry so defenders can rebuild stronger.

> *"You either harden, or you get owned. Pick a side."*

## ⚖️ Rules of Engagement — Non-Negotiable

1. Written authorization is mandatory.
2. Predefined blast radius and rollback plan.
3. Real-time kill switch in place.
4. Use synthetic data for exfil simulation only.
5. Sanitize deliverables.

---

## 🧪 Lab Playbooks — Templates

### AD Emulation Lab

* Create isolated lab network with nested virtualization.
* Provision DC, 2-3 Windows clients, 1 attacker VM.
* Install telemetry agents: winlogbeat/filebeat → ELK/Splunk.
* Seed fake users, service accounts, and credentials.
* Run mapping and simulated attacks, observe detection.

### Cloud Misconfiguration Lab

* Use isolated test cloud account (AWS/Azure/GCP).
* Deploy minimal infra: VM, storage bucket, IAM role.
* Intentionally misconfigure for lab simulation.
* Simulate abuse and monitor telemetry.
* Destroy all resources after testing.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Hunting Notes & Indicators

* Sudden DNS query spikes or anomalous auth patterns.
* Suspicious new services or scheduled tasks.
* LSASS access or credential dump attempts (lab only).
* Abnormal outbound connections.

---

## 📦 Deliverables

* Executive Hit-List (1 page): business impact summary.
* Technical Kill-Chain: step-by-step reproduction (sanitized).
* IOC & Detection Pack: Sigma, Splunk, ELK queries.
* Purple Team Session: live walkthrough and tuning.

---

## ⚠️ Legal & Ethics

Authorized testing only. No permission = no engagement.

---

## 📣 Extra Flair & Sources

* Embedded hacker GIF (animated)
* ASCII art and badges
* OSINT sources, malware labs, cloud security labs, network scanning, and AD attack simulations
