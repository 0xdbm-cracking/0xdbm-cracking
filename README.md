## 🔥 About — The Dark Red Team

I am **0xdbm-cracking** — a red team operator who simulates real-world adversaries to surface weaknesses and harden defenses. This README is the operational profile: skillset, tooling, engagement philosophy, and how to collaborate.

> *"Identify the gaps. Exploit with precision. Fortify without a trace."*

---

## 🎯 Core Mission

* **Red Team Engagements:** Realistic, multi-stage attack simulations to validate detection and response.
* **Adversary Emulation:** Reproduce TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) used by real threat actors.
* **Purple Teaming:** Work with defenders to close gaps and improve telemetry.
* **Proactive Security:** Attack surface management, threat hunting, and detection engineering.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Expertise

> This list is illustrative and intended for authorized testing and defensive learning only.

* **Recon & OSINT:** Amass, Subfinder, theHarvester, Maltego
* **Discovery & Scanning:** Nmap, Masscan, Nikto, Nessus/OpenVAS
* **Exploitation & Post-Ex:** Metasploit, Cobalt Strike (lab), custom frameworks (Go/Python)
* **Adversary Simulation:** Atomic Red Team, MITRE Caldera, BloodHound
* **Web Application:** Burp Suite, sqlmap (authorized testing only)
* **Scripting & Automation:** Python, Bash, PowerShell, Go
* **Detection & Logging:** ELK/EFK stacks, Splunk, Sigma rules
* **Cloud & Identity:** AWS/Azure reconnaissance and simulated abuse in lab environments

## 🧩 Rules of Engagement

1. **Authorization First.** All activity requires explicit written scope and permission.
2. **Minimal Impact.** Avoid production disruption — use snapshots, isolated labs, and safe test ranges.
3. **Responsible Disclosure.** Document findings and report through agreed channels.
4. **Defensive Outcome.** Objective: improve security posture and detection coverage.

## ⚙️ Lab Setup (Quick Example)

> Quick example to spin up a personal lab. This is for learning and authorized testing only.

```bash
# clone personal tooling repo
git clone https://github.com/0xdbm-cracking/tooling-lab.git
cd tooling-lab
# follow internal README to start docker/vagrant/terraform lab
```

---

## 📂 Portfolio & Deliverables

* **CTF Writeups:** Selected writeups and lessons learned (sanitized).
* **Labs:** Active Directory emulation, cloud compromise scenarios, and full-chain simulations.
* **Engagement Reports:** Redacted sample reports showing findings, IOCs, and prioritized mitigations.

> Access to artifacts requires proof of authorization — contact for access.
